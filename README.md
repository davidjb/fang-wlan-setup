# WLAN setup without using Mi Home

This code was originally sourced from
https://github.com/samtap/fang-hacks/issues/132 and adapted accordingly.

## Disclaimer

Users of this modification do so at their own risk

## How to

1. Copy all files from the ZIP-file on to the sd-card. Should look like:
   ![SD Card listing](sdcard.jpg)

2. Open .wifissid and .wifipasswd with a text editor and enter your Wlan details.

3. Boot your Cam WITHOUT Sd-card and wait until the blue light is flashing. 
   Now put the SD-card into the Cam and wait 10 secs. You should hear "kling-klang".

4. Now pull the power and plug it in again. Cam will now reboot and update your Wlan settings

5. Be happy :D
